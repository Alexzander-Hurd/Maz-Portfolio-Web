    I'm a 23-year-old artist and photographer from South Yorkshire, and this is
    my space to share the creative work that means the most to me.

    I was diagnosed with autism at 17. For years, I masked my traits in order to
    fit in, but around 19 I began unmasking — and with that came the heavy
    weight of anxiety. It was a painful transition, but also the start of
    something more honest. Art became my lifeline: a way to process the world,
    express what words often can't, and navigate the intense emotions of
    becoming more fully myself.

    In 2025, I discovered photography alongside my partner. Every weekend we'd
    head out with our cameras, capturing the world in new ways. I work with both
    film and digital — using an Olympus OM-1 and a Canon 1300D — and my
    photography page reflects that mix. There you'll find everything from
    wildlife to architecture, each image part of my growing exploration of
    visual storytelling.

    This website brings together my artwork, my photography, and my journey. I
    hope that as you explore, you'll not only see my work but also feel the
    experiences and emotions that shape it.
